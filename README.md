# Introduction
- We used PokemonGo dataset featuring the occurrences of different pokemon and the rich set of features of the physical location, time, etc. We did data cleaning to make the dataset easy to manipulate with, and used SystemG to make some exploratory data analysis to get insight about the data. Then we performed various machine learning algorithms regarding the binary labels of the dataset and compared the results, including PySpark’s MlLib library. Finally we filter the dataset to that of NYC and compared some of the rare pokemons’ frequency in the city with the relevant complaints received from 311. This comparison indicates further work that may shed light on feature engineering and predictive analytics.
